# Software University - Learning Path

SoftUni's software engineering curriculum is a combination of programming and technology courses, entirely aimed at acquiring fundamental knowledge and practical skills for working with the most modern software technologies needed to acquire the profession of "software engineer".

The curriculum consists of several professional fields and subsequent specializations, built from specially selected training modules. Each training module contains courses with a strong focus on practice. and at the end of each course, students go through a practical exam, demonstrating the acquired skills.

With "Programming Fundamentals" the students go deeper into the SoftUni learning path. The course is going over fundamental programming concepts, that lay beneth the efective trainings in the Professional modules. The students upgrade the knowledge aquired in the Programming Basics course and start to use more complex programming skills and methods like:
arrays, lists, objects and classes.

Additional technologies learned in the course are HTML, CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations which are a must for every web developer. The basics of Web development are studied thoroughly and by doing so, the students are better prepared for the upcomming professional modules and their path to becoming successful Web Developers.

## 2. Professional Modules - Python Web Developer

### 2.1 Python Advanced
__Months: 4__

In the "Python Advanced" module, students learn the Python language in depth, learning more serious and complex programming concepts, such as tulips, stacks, queues, matrices, and their application in practice. In addition, students will learn to use basic concepts in object-oriented programming and create their own projects using these concepts. As a result of the acquired knowledge, at the end of the module students will be able to build large projects, to navigate in them, applying popular methodologies and good practices for writing code. The focus is on upgrading students' algorithmic thinking and solving more complex architectural problems.

#### 2.1.1 Python Advanced

he Python Advanced course builds on Python language skills by addressing more complex language-specific concepts (such as modules and comprehension). In the course you will learn to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with stacks and queues (Stacks & Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples & Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists), files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. You will take a closer look at lamba functions, recursive functions, and multi-argument functions. The development environment that will be used by the training team is PyCharm, but each student is free to use tools of their choice.

#### 2.1.2 Python OOP
[Solved Problems]<br>
__Credits: 12__<br>
__Grade:__

The Python OOP course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. We will get acquainted with the SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We will learn what iterators and generators are and how to use them. We will learn how to create and use decorators. We will pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).

### 2.2 Python Web
__Months: 4__

The Python Web module examines the basics of web-based technology and the most popular framework in the world of Python - Django. In addition, students will learn how to handle dynamic information by acquiring basic knowledge of working with databases. Students learn to build web applications, starting with simple applications that require basic knowledge of HTTP protocol and work with it, gradually leading to complex concepts. Throughout the training, students create web applications that face the problems of practice and begin to understand in depth the possibilities of technology. The module ends with the development and protection of their own web applications, which are the first step towards starting their career as software developers.

#### 2.2.1 Python Web Basics

In the Python Web Basics course we will lay the basics of Web programming with Python and Django. We will get acquainted with the basic principles of web development, such as HTTP Protocol, we will learn to work with databases (SQL), we will create our own server and we will get acquainted with the basic concepts in the MVC architecture.

#### 2.2.2 Python Web Framework
[Solved Problems]<br>
__Credits: 15__<br>
__Grade:__

In the Python Web Framework course we will go into the details of Python programming using one of the most popular Python frameworks - Django. We will learn how to work with databases in Django (PostgreSQL), how to use template inheritance, how to work with media files. In addition, we will learn how to register, log in and log users. We will also get acquainted with the Django REST Framework. During the course we will practice what we have learned by building many applications.

### 2.3 Javascript Advanced
__Months: 4__

In the "JS Advanced" module you will get acquainted in more detail with the functionality of the JavaScript language, with the environment in which it is most often used and for which it is created - the browser. We will look at JavaScript as a basic syntax, as we will learn concepts in programming through the prism of the language. What is functional programming and what are the differences with object-oriented programming. You will learn in detail the elements of the browser, the DOM tree, how to add, remove and edit the elements in it. What is unit testing and what are the basic techniques for testing code. At the end of the module you will have the necessary knowledge to create an application of the type Single Page Applications, written entirely in JavaScript, using concepts such as Routing and Templating.
